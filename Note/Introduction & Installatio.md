# Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static types, classes, interfaces, and other features to JavaScript, enabling developers to write more scalable and maintainable code. TypeScript code is typically transpiled into JavaScript code, which can then be executed in any JavaScript runtime environment.

## Key Features

- **Static Typing:** TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing developers to specify types for variables, function parameters, return types, and more. This helps catch type-related errors during development and provides better code documentation.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** TypeScript supports object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, and access modifiers, making it easier to organize and structure code.
- **Enhanced Tooling:** TypeScript offers enhanced tooling support, including code editors with IntelliSense, code navigation, and refactoring capabilities, which improve developer productivity and code quality.
- **Compatibility with JavaScript:** Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript code can be gradually migrated to TypeScript, and TypeScript code can seamlessly interoperate with JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
- **Rich Configuration Options:** TypeScript provides a rich set of configuration options through the `tsconfig.json` file, allowing developers to customize compilation settings, target environments, module systems, and more.

## Installation

### Node.js Installation

TypeScript is typically installed via npm, which comes bundled with Node.js. If you haven't already installed Node.js, download and install it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org).

### Open Terminal or Command Prompt

Once Node.js is installed, open your terminal or command prompt.

### Install TypeScript

Use npm to install TypeScript globally by running the following command:

npm install -g typescript


This command installs the TypeScript compiler globally on your system, making it available as a command-line tool (`tsc`).

### Verify Installation

After installation, you can verify that TypeScript is installed correctly by checking its version. Run the following command:

tsc --version

This command should display the installed version of TypeScript.
